# Day 1: Python Fundamentals

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Study Time:** 7 hours  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 📚 What I Covered

### 1. Python for Everybody (Py4e) - Chapter 2
- Completed all chapter content and assignments
- Variables and expressions
- Data types: integers, floats, and strings
- Type conversions and casting
- User input with `input()`
- Basic operators and mathematical operations

### 2. Rosalind Problems
- Solved 2 problems applying Python fundamentals
- Practice with input/output operations

### 3. DataCamp - Python Basics
- Reinforced core Python concepts
- Hands-on practice with data types

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

**Data Types:**
- `int` - Integers (whole numbers)
- `float` - Floating-point numbers (decimals)
- `str` - Strings (text)

**Type Conversion:**
- `int()` - Convert to integer
- `float()` - Convert to float
- `str()` - Convert to string
- Understanding when and why to convert between types

**Input/Output:**
- Using `input()` to read user data
- Using `print()` to display results
- Parsing multiple inputs with `split()` and `map()`

## 🔧 Practice Program: Pythagorean Theorem Calculator

**File:** `Read_input.py`

This program calculates the square of the hypotenuse given two sides of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b²).

```python
# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate square of hypotenuse
hypotenuse_squared = a**2 + b**2

# Output
print(hypotenuse_squared)
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- Reading multiple inputs on one line
- Type conversion with `map(int, ...)`
- Mathematical operations with `**` (exponentiation)
- Clean code structure with comments

## 📝 Reflection

I feel solid on the basic concepts but will need more practice with type conversions to build confidence. The hands-on coding with the Pythagorean theorem program helped solidify how to structure input/output operations.

## ⏭️ Next Up: Day 2

Continue building Python foundations with more complex programs and problem-solving.
